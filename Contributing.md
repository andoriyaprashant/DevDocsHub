## 🧑‍💻 Code Style Guidelines

To keep the codebase clean and consistent, please adhere to these guidelines:

- **Python Code:** Follow [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) for Python code.
- **Commit Messages:** Use clear, descriptive commit messages in the **imperative mood** (e.g., "Add new button" instead of "Added new button").
- **Testing:** Ensure all existing tests pass, and if possible, write tests for new functionality you’ve added.

## 🛠 Reporting Issues

Found a bug? Have a great idea for a feature? We’d love to hear from you!

1. **Check Existing Issues:** Before creating a new issue, please check if the issue has already been reported.
2. **Open a New Issue:** If it hasn’t been reported yet, open a new issue and clearly describe:
   - What the issue is
   - How to reproduce it
   - Suggested solutions, if any

## 🎯 Pull Request Guidelines

When opening a pull request (PR):
- Clearly explain the purpose of your PR in the description.
- If the PR addresses an issue, link it using the format: `Fixes #issue-number`.
- Ensure your code is clean, passes all tests, and is ready for review.
  
We’ll do our best to review your PR as quickly as possible. 🙌
