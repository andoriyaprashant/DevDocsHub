**Getting Started**

DevDocsHub is easy to set up and use. Here's a quick guide:

**Prerequisites:**

* Python 3.x installed on your system
* Basic knowledge of Git version control (recommended)

**Installation:**

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/andoriyaprashant/DevDocsHub.git
   cd DevDocsHub
   ```

2. **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment:**

   This step isolates project dependencies and avoids conflicts with your system-wide Python installation. 

   **Windows:**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

   **macOS/Linux:**

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install <package_name>
   ```

4. **Apply Database Migrations:**

   This step prepares the database schema for the application:

   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

5. **Start the Development Server:**

   This command launches DevDocsHub locally for testing and development:

   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

   By default, the server will be running at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`. You can access DevDocsHub in your web browser at this address.
